# Instant Lyrics
Do you want to see the lyrics for the song you're listening to, but typing the song title and artist on a search engine is just too much for you? Well, now you don't have to.

Utilizing ID3 tags that is on your audio files, Instant Lyrics knows what you're listening to. Instant Lyrics brings you the lyrics for any and every song that you are currently playing with the stock Music app. 

##TL;DR

#### Install
* Build and run by opening the .xcodeproj file
* You don't have to have a developer account to load apps to your device ([More info](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/))

#### Why is this not on the App store?
Apple rejected this app because lyrics are usually copyrighted. I was asked to prove that I have rights to display any lyrics that could ever show up from a search query (turns out displaying those websites alone required rights). At this point in time, there is nothing I could do about it.
